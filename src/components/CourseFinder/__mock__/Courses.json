Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage Hershey AD and Chase M.; J Gen Physiol. 1952 May;36(1):39-56. Note: This paper demonstrates that DNA, and not protein, component of phages enter bacterial cells. 3. Molecular structure of nucleic acids; a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid Watson JD and Crick FH; Nature. 1953 Apr 25;171(4356):737-8 Note: In this one page paper Watson and Crick first described the structure of DNA double helix Study help - Watson_Crick_Nature_1953_annotated 4. Transposable mating type genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae James Hicks, Jeffrey N. Strathern & Amar J.S. Klar; Nature 282, 478-483,1979 Note: This paper provided evidence for \u2018cassette hypothesis\u2019 of yeast mating type switches i.e. interconversion of mating types in yeast (S. cerevisiae) occurs by DNA rearrangement. 5. Messelson & Stahl experiment demonstrating semi-conservative replication of DNA. Meselson M and Stahl FW.; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1958 Jul 15;44(7):671-82 Note: The experiment demonstrating semi-conservative mode of DNA replication is referred to as \"the most beautiful experiment in biology\" 6. In vivo alteration of telomere sequences and senescence caused by mutated Tetrahymena telomerase RNAs Guo-Liang Yu, John D. Bradley, Laura D. Attardi & Elizabeth H. Blackburn; Nature 344, 126-132, 1990 Note: This paper demonstrates that the telomerase contains the template for telomere synthesis. Cell Biology 1.

Identification of 23 complementation groups required for post-translational events in the yeast secretory pathway Novick P, Field C, Schekman R.; Cell. 1980 Aug;21(1):205-15 Note: In this groundbreaking paper Randy Schekman`s group used a mutagenesis screen for fast sedimenting yeast mutants to identify genes involved in cell secretion 3. A yeast mutant defective at an early stage in import of secretory protein precursors into the endoplasmic reticulum Deshaies RJ and Schekman R.; J Cell Biol. 1987 Aug;105(2):633-45 Note: Using another yeast mutation screen Schekman lab identifies Sec61, a component of ER protein Conducting Channel (PCC) Suggested reference paper - A biochemical assay for identification of PCC. 4. Reconstitution of the Transport of Protein between Successive Compartments of the Golgi Balch WE, Dunphy WG, Braell WA, Rothman JE.; Cell. 1984 Dec;39(2 Pt 1):405-16 Note: This paper describes setting up of an in vitro reconstituted system for transport between golgi stacks which eventually paved the way for identification of most of the molecular players involved in these steps including NSF, SNAP etc. 5. A complete immunoglobulin gene is created by somatic recombination Brack C, Hirama M, Lenhard-Schuller R, Tonegawa S.; Cell. 1978 Sep;15(1):1-14 Note: This study demonstrates DNA level molecular details of somatic rearrangement of immunoglobulin gene sequences leading to the generation of functionally competent antibody generating gene following recombination. 6. A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition Buck L and Axel R; Cell. 1991 Apr 5;65(1):175-87 Note: This paper suggests that different chemical odorants associate with different cell-specific expression of a transmembrane receptor in Drosophila olfactory epithelium where a large family of odorat receptors is expressed. 7. Kinesin walks hand-over-hand Yildiz A, Tomishige M, Vale RD, Selvin PR.; Science. 2004 Jan 30;303(5658):676-8 Note: This paper shows that kinesin motor works as a two-headed dimeric motor walking hand-over-hand rather than like an inchworm on microtubule tract using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Developmental Biology/ Genetics 1. Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila Christiane Nusslein-Volhard and Eric Weischaus; Nature 287, 795-801, 1980 Note: This single mutagenesis screen identified majority of the developmentally important genes not only in flies but in other metazoans as well. 2. Information for the dorsal--ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo is stored as maternal mRNA Anderson KV and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard C; Nature. 1984 Sep 20-26;311(5983):223-7 Note: This landmark paper demonstrated that early dorsal-ventral pattern information is stored as maternal mRNA in flies and devised the method of identifying genes encoding such genes 3. Hedgehog signalling in the mouse requires intraflagellar transport proteins Huangfu D, Liu A, Rakeman AS, Murcia NS, Niswander L, Anderson KV.; Nature. 2003 Nov 6;426(6962):83-7 Note: One of the architects of original fly mutagenesis screens conducted a mouse mutagenes screen which identified a gene Kif3a as a major component of hedgehog signaling pathway.

This uncertainty is in the form of uncertainty (noise) in measurements as well as disturbances/noise in the process. The theory covered will deal with estimation for dynamic systems for both linear and nonlinear processes, as well as for gaussian and non-gaussian noise characteristics. Issues related to constraints on process states (constrained estimation), and delayed and multirate measurements will also be dealt with. It is expected that this course will expose the student to not only the well-accepted basics of estimation, but also to recent advances in this area. Throughout the course, the main ideas will be illustrated using matlab-based examples. The following topics will be covered: (i) Linear Optimal (Kalman) Filtering: Least squares formulation, Stochastic formulation, Riccatti equation and solution techniques, Sensitivity and sub-optimal filtering, Smoothing. (ii) Nonlinear Filtering with Gaussian Noise: Extended Kalman filtering, Unscented Kalman filtering. (iii) Particle Filtering: Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) methods, Markov processes, SMC based particle filtering, Resampling-MOVE algorithm, Importance sampling, SMC based smoothing, Self organizing state space models, Regularization in particle filtering.

For example, self-driven vehicles use ML components, wrong decisions by which can lead to fatal accidents. The ACAS Xu system for collision avoidance of autonomous drones is another such example, where a neural network is required to satisfy properties rigorously specified in logic. Formal robustness guarantees of image classification networks require the class label to not change until the image is perturbed beyond an acceptable threshold. For various historical reasons, mainstream ML research has focused on development of an extremely rich set of tools, techiniques and models that can be used to perform extremely well in most scenarios, without formal guarantees in all possible corner cases. In this course, we will be primarily interested in the behaviour of ML components in these hard-to-fish-out corner case scenarious. We will study how techniques from formal methods (FM) can be used to provide rigorous guarantees of the behaviour of ML components like deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Formal methods have been successfully used to provide rigorous guarantees for hardware and software systems in the past, related work leading to at least three Turing Awards. The application of FM to prove properties of modern ML components, however, presents new challenges due to the scale and size of these ML components, and also because of the specifics of their operation. Over the last decade, this has spurred a lot of interest from both the ML and FM research communities, and formal methods for machine learning is now a routine track in most ML/FM conferences. This course will primarily focus on four threads of research in this area: (i) use of abstraction refinement for analyzing DNNs, (ii) use of specialized constraint solving techniques for reasoning about DNNs, (iii) automata theoretic analysis of RNNs, and (iv) formal methods for explainability and robustness of ML components. The course should be useful for students of both formal methods and machine learning, and lies at the intersection of these areas.", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "The course material will be primarily based on research papers.", "LastUpdate": "01-07-2021", "Structure": {"Type": "T", "Lecture": "6", "Tutorial": "0", "Practical": "0", "Selfstudy": "0", "HalfSemester": "N"}}, {"id": 8057, "Department": "Computer Science and Engineering", "Code": "CS 621", "Title": "Artificial Intelligence", "TotalCredits": "6", "Description": "Prerequisites: Undergraduate Course on Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Representation: The First Order Predicate Logic, Production Systems, Semantic Nets, Frames and Scripts Formalisms.

Topics to discuss will include Convexity, Gradient Methods, Proximal algorithms, Stochastic and Online Variants of mentioned methods, Coordinate Descent Methods, Subgradient Methods, Non-Convex Optimization, FrankWolfe, Accelerated Methods, Lagrange and Fenchel Duality, Second-Order Methods, Quasi-Newton Methods, Gradient-Free and Zero-Order Optimization. We will also cover some advanced topics including non-convex optimization, alternating minimization algorithms and parallel/distributed variants of algorithms. We will ground all these algorithms with applications and loss functions in machine learning (starting from logistic regression, linear regression, svms, matrix factorization right up to deep neural networks). Summarily,in Continuous Optimization we will cover topics such as Basics of Continuous Optimization, Convexity, Gradient Descent, Projected/Proximal GD, Subgradient Descent, Accelerated Gradient Descent, Newton & Quasi Newton, Duality: Legrange, Fenchel, Coordinate Descent, Frank Wolfe, Continuous Optimization in Practice, etc. The second part of this course will cover the fundamentals of discrete optimization. We will start with basic forms of combinatorial optimization (knapsack, s-t cuts/paths, matchings and matroids) and then discuss submodular functions and their applications. We will cover algorithms for submodular minimization and maximization under various combinatorial constraints. We will also discuss discrete probabilistic models such as Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs). We will ground all these algorithmic and theoretical results with real world applications in feature selection, summarization and diversified search, structured prediction, data subset selection and model compression. Summarily, in Discrete Optimization we will cover topics such as Linear Cost Problems with Applications in ML, Matroids, Spanning Trees, s-t paths, s-t cuts, Matchings, Covers (Set Covers, Vertex Covers, Edge Covers), Non-Linear Discrete Optimization, Submodular Functions and Applications in Machine Learning, Submodularity and Convexity, Submodular Minimization, Submodular Maximization, Beyond Minimization and Maximization: Other forms of Submodular Optimization, Discrete Optimization in Practice", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "1) S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, \u201cConvex Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity\u201d, In Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning 8(3-4): 231-357 (2015).

With the commercial launch of the Fifth Generation of Mobile Radio Networks (5G) in 2020, antenna engineers need more than ever to be aware of physical layer strategies that are currently considered to reach the expected performance. With techniques such as MIMO and millimeter-wave communications, new challenges arise and antenna engineers cannot afford anymore to be only expert in electromagnetics, but do also require skills regarding propagation channel, digital modulations, and coding aspects. New communications schemes use advanced signal processing and coding techniques in order to exploit as much as possible the propagation channel to maximize some metrics such as the capacity. The antenna being a part of the channel, its properties influence the overall performance, and knowledge of physical layer features is therefore of utmost importance in the antenna design. This course addresses important theoretical concepts in the field of antennas and propagation in the context of 5G communications. The first unit of the course introduces physical layer aspects that have to be considered while designing antenna solutions. The second unit tackles MIMO aspects and how antenna performance should be specifically assessed accordingly. The third unit illustrates some specific issues related to vehicular and ehealth applications. The fourth unit introduces the challenges faced while using millimeterwaves for communications. This unit IV also addresses in detail two advanced antenna technologies, namely, leaky-wave antennas and Substrate-Integrated-Waveguide-based antennas. It is to be noted that theoretical concept in this course are not limited to 5G communications and are therefore useful to any antenna engineer.", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "Goldsmith, A.

Learning is an important aspect of life. Every living being learns to survive. As Charles Darwin hypothesized about the existence of various species in the world that a living being struggles to exist. And whoever is biologically fit will exists otherwise would perish from the world. Following this Karl Popper, one of the eminent philosophers of science advocates evolutionary epistemology. Learning defined in the theoretical framework of evolutionary epistemology shows the knowledge acquisition happens due to certain biological disposition. The biological need of life explains the necessity of knowledge. Learning therefore remains a continuous activity. One continues to learn in order to remain in the world. So the notion of survival or enduring life goes along with seeking information and bringing change in accord with the information of one\u2019s own well being. The enduring life here refers to an active life where the being participates in the world for its well being. Human life is such that the act of knowledge seeking, which Aristotle defines as the desire to know is something very primitive. It is not merely part of human biological history but also significant for understanding the cultural history. The biological history of human life is significant as it has helped us developing our food habits and medicine. The cultural history tells us understanding the development of values in general and institutions and institutional values in particular. The development of culture is significant because human life is not merely confined to certain biological activities. Rather human life transcends the limit of biological existence. This transcendence is embedded in the very attitude of knowledge seeking \u2013 learning. Learning pervades both the biological forms of life as well as the cultural forms of life. Interestingly the well being of human life requires both that is the biological fitness and the cultural elegance. In this course, we study philosophical ideas of Plato, Aristotle, Jacque Rousseau, John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Nel Nodding, Paulo Freire, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo and Jiddu Krishnamurthi.

Yet there are profound differences in the larger cultural context for ethical decision-making. As international collaborations become more common, new generations of scholars enter the field of research, and norms and consequences of research become more complicated, these differences need to be more fully confronted. Standard guidelines on responsible conduct of research or IPR / Copyright rules tend to ignore cross-cultural challenges of ethical decision-making in the scientific endeavor, and also ignore alternate perspectives and approaches to such issues. Moving away from norms that are largely proscriptive, field- and country-specific, and from guidelines and approaches to ethical issues that are universalizing, or based on fundamentally western notions of individual intellectual property rights rather than collaborative values, this course places emphasis upon cultural context and upon partnership with international scholars and diverse community groups in developing a new kind of training in scholarly integrity. Through discussing a range of topics from science and engineering especially related to issues of development and change, the course aims to develop skills related to decisions making in the scientific endeavour \u2013 from issues of methodology and development paradigms, to issues of responsibility, informed consent, intellectual property rights, commons, natural resources, livelihoods, sustainability, participation, and scientific and engineering ethics codes. Case studies from real life will be used as tools for class room based workshops on ethical decision making in different scientific arenas. Contentious issues from areas such as biotechnology, civil engineering, water resources management, IPRs/creative commons, and environmental risks will form the core of issues around which teaching will be organized. Topics to be covered1. Introduction: What is ethics? What is morality? What is responsibility?2. Methodology, Epistemology and Ethics: Positivism and its critiques, nature of data, qualitative vs quantitative research3. Thinking about Development: choices and paradigms4. Intellectual Property and Property Rights; Open Access and Creative Commons5. Cultural Competence, Cultural Humility and Participatory Research6.

In this course, we will examine some of the influential scholarship that constitutes the field of Postcolonial Studies. We will look at a few of the important debates that were waged, including a fierce one on the legitimacy of the term 302221postcolonial302222 itself, the critical vocabulary and methodological tools that developed, and analytical practices that this field engendered. Some of the topics that the course may wish to emphasize upon are as follows: 1) colonial discourse analysis, which forms a significant part of Postcolonial Studies, especially in the formative years. 2) The institutional and disciplinary history of the development of Postcolonial Studies: how it was and is conditioned by it development in the Anglo-American academy, specifically in English departments, since the1980s. 3) Postcolonial Studies302222 relationship with other parallel fields302227 such as Cultural Studies, Feminism and Queer Studies, Memory and Trauma Studies, and so on302227which have overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, concerns with Postcolonial Studies. 4) New directions and future of Postcolonial Studies.In selecting texts and debates from what is a robust field, we may show a bias for those that pertain to the Indian subcontinent. While reference to literary studies and literary texts will assume importance in our endeavour, this course is not intended to be a literature survey course.", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "Gandhi, Leela.

The setup of a basic planewave based-DFT calculator and the role of different simulation parameters on the obtained results would be discussed. The use of DFT calculator to calculate observable material properties such as bulk modulus, material density, speed of sound in materials, material stability, etc (without using any prior material knowledge) and their comparison with experimentally measured values (from textbook and literature) will be presented. The shortcomings of DFT calculations in predicting electronic bandgaps, handling strongly correlated solids (such as oxides) will be discussed. The course will conclude by presenting beyond-DFT machine learning based methods for accelerated material discovery. Students will work on individual projects where they will demonstrate the use of DFT calculation in their research and/or on an interesting scientific problem. Content: - Basics of programming in Python (different data types, loops, conditional execution, functions, modules, plotting), Python modules-numpy and matplotlib, introduction to atomic simulation environment (ase), ase visualization tools, introduction to unix-based HPC platform for calculations. - Introduction to crystal structures, lattice, basis, surfaces, interatomic interactions, force-fields, pair potentials, shortcomings of force-fields, introduction to DFT theory (basics only for completion). - Setting up DFT calculator via ASE-Python, choice and convergence of results with different DFT parameters, accuracy/speed trade-off, obtaining electronic energies and bandgaps. - Using DFT calculations to get Bulk modulus, material density, speed of sound, formation energies, and other observable material properties. - Under-prediction of electronic bandgaps, over/under bindings, strongly correlated solids, heavy atoms.", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "- John R.

In second part, We will use a systems analysis approach to make connections between the chemical and physical changes that occur in food systems and their impact on food quality. \"Smart foods\" and \"Functional foods\" will be covered which stay on three pillars namely - food chemistry, food microbiology and food process engineering. Specifically, we will cover technologies adopted in the processing of cereals, pulses, fruits & vegetables, oilseeds, sugars, dairy products and beverages. Numerical problems in food process engineering concepts including food properties, material and energy balances, kinetics, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat and mass transfer will also be covered. Students will also review and discuss the case studies and application of advance technologies such as microwave, ultrasonics, supercritical fluids extraction, high pressure processing in this course. Third part includes review of food policy papers and fourth part is dedicated to hands on work by the students in food processing laboratory. Some sample lab experiments are- 1. Determinations of proximate composition of food products (moisture, sugars, proteins, starches, crude fibre, total minerals, fat). 2. Estimation of proteins and vitamins 3. Analysis of lipids - Saponification value, acid value and iodine value 4. Drying kinetics of different food products using various drying systems 5.

It is a fixed sequence of steps and procedures and with an expected set of outcomes. This course is aimed at exposing students to specific protocols in the water, energy, environment and agriculture sector using both policy analysis and field methods. The course will require students to carry out one of the protocols and practices already developed in CTARA and to report the outcomes. Examples of such protocols are:(i)Analysis of a piped water supply scheme: This protocol will analyze an existing water supply scheme. The aspects covered will be technical, socio-economic and institutional, such as demand and supply, source and strength of source, simulations of systems, study of pani-samiti and so on. It will involve meeting with all stakeholders, such as beneficiary villages, elected representatives, department engineers etc., and building a document analyzing the scheme as per existing protocols.(ii)Analysis of a jaggery plant: This protocol will analyze the working of an existing jaggery plant. It will measure the technical a well as the socio-economic parameters of the plant. This includes thermal efficiency, feed-stock, packaging, bagasse re-use, operations and so on.The course will begin with training the student in the methodology and tools required to execute the protocol. This may be, e.g., instrumentation, simulation, questionnaire development, documentation etc. This will be followed by the protocol itself. Finally, the outcome of the protocol will be documented and reported in a suggested format to all stakeholders. Evaluation of the student will be based on the reporting and analysis of using the protocol. The student must submit a report and make a presentation.", "Prerequisite": null, "TextReference": "Handouts as per the requirement", "LastUpdate": "27-11-2017", "Structure": {"Type": "T", "Lecture": "1", "Tutorial": "0", "Practical": "0", "Selfstudy": "0", "HalfSemester": "N"}}, {"id": 21033, "Department": "Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas", "Code": "TD 694", "Title": "Seminar", "TotalCredits": "4", "Description": null, "Prerequisite": "0", "TextReference": null, "LastUpdate": null, "Structure": {"Type": "S", "Lecture": "0", "Tutorial": "0", "Practical": "0", "Selfstudy": "0", "HalfSemester": "N"}}, {"id": 21034, "Department": "Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas", "Code": "TD 695", "Title": "I Stage Project", "TotalCredits": "18", "Description": null, "Prerequisite": "0", "TextReference": null, "LastUpdate": "31-07-2009", "Structure": {"Type": "M1", "Lecture": "0", "Tutorial": "0", "Practical": "0", "Selfstudy": "0", "HalfSemester": "N"}}, {"id": 21035, "Department": "Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas", "Code": "TD 696", "Title": "II Stage Project", "TotalCredits": "40", "Description": null, "Prerequisite": "0", "TextReference": null, "LastUpdate": "19-08-2010", "Structure": {"Type": "M2", "Lecture": "0", "Tutorial": "0", "Practical": "0", "Selfstudy": "0", "HalfSemester": "N"}}, {"id": 21036, "Department": "Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas", "Code": "TD 792", "Title": "Communication Skills -II", "TotalCredits": "4", "Description": "1.Critical Thinking2.Communication and Social Media3.Demonstration and Evaluation of Scientific Reports, Field Reports, Note Taking Techniques4.Technological Interventions and Development: Discussion and Debates 5.Reading Technical papers, Summary writing, Literature survey and Organization6.Report Writing and Formatting7.Ethics and Plagiarism: Case Studies8.Stakeholders Perspectives- Listening, Understanding and Analyzing multiple situations; Role Play9.Discussion on Contextual Viewpoint, Non-verbal Communication, Analysis of Mannerisms During Interactions and Presentations10.

The perspective of the course is critical and technical. It will illuminate the explicit and tacit knowledge underlying the practice of urban planning in India. Through a case study approach, students will understand the diversity of urban planning practices, as well as the challenges faced in provision of urban infrastructural services at different scales. Through actual site visits and small problem-solving exercises, students will explore sectoral interconnectedness and gaps. The course is also designed to enable students to think through urban challenges using multipronged strategic interventions. 9.

Practically, it is also shaped by the interplay, synergies and conflicts of these perspectives in policy, politics and popular practice. This course provides an introduction to key perspectives drawing on diverse foundational and contemporary debates across fields like urban planning, human geography, critical urban theory, and urban environmentalism. It unpacks the taken-for-grantedness of urban space by illuminating the underlying complexity of the processes through which social and spatial `forces` shape each other. Such understanding is an important basis for effective practice (e.g. urban and infrastructural design, or policy practice) as well as research across social, design, and policy domains. The course will be taught with a mix of theoretical lectures, case studies and guided classroom discussions.

How individuals and organizations use the language of design to develop conceptual attributes of successful identity design would be studied. While developing your own characters you consider factors such as intended audience, visual impact, exaggeration of features, scale, material and purpose The practical component focuses on the use of hand and power tools to explore various materials and techniques. The intensive hands-on processes which may include modelling, carving, molding, casting, assembling, stitching, etc. To execute tangible character along with the documentation, students will create backstories, props and environments to both fill out and fine tune their Designs.

Broadly speaking, organisations can follow several different \u201cavenues\u201d to achieve sustainable growth: (a) they can grow in their existing business through innovation, consolidation, etc. or (b) they can grow by expanding the \u201cscope of their activities\u201d along the business value chain, or by expanding the \u201cscope of the products, markets or businesses\u201d they are engaged in. Further, in pursuing any of these growth avenues, organisations can decide to grow organically through \u201cinternal development\u201d or they can choose to grow inorganically through either \u201calliances\u201d or \u201cacquisitions\u201d. Thus, growth strategy involves making choices along both dimensions of growth \u2013 the \u201cavenues of growth\u201d and the \u201cmode of growth or expansion\u201d.
